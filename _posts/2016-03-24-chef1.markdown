Original post series was done by this guy
http://www.jeeatwork.com/?p=102

inside of the chef tutorials.


So plan is basically following:c
# create basic cookbook
# apply cookbook to local linux
# create docker recipe for provisioning
# apply cookbook to docker
# create vagrant recipe for provisioning
# apply cookbook to vagrant
# crate vagrant recipe for ec2
# apply cookbookt to ec2


lets create our big project folder, make it git repo and create cookbooks folder where we will store all our cookbooks

```
mkdir big_chef
cd big_chef
git init
mkdir cookbooks
cd cookbooks
```

now we can  create cookbook. this is done via

```
knife cookbook create cheftutorial -o .
```

after this we go to cheftutorial\recipes
and create file welcome.rb

```
log "Hello #{ENV['USER']}" do
  level :info
end
```

and after that you can apply this recipe locally on windows or linux. Which you prefer the most.

here how it looks on linux box

```
vagrant@vagrant-VirtualBox:~/cheftutorial/recipes$ chef-apply welcome.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * log[Hello vagrant] action write


```

and here's snaphost of windows output

```
C:\Users\otaykalo\projects\bigchef\cheftutorial> chef-apply .\recipes\welcom.rb
Recipe: (chef-apply cookbook)::(chef-apply recipe)
  * log[Hello otaykalo] action write

```

looks pretty similar, which is nice.

So now we can go further. To share information between recipes whe can use *attributes*

attributes are stored in files indide _attributes_ directory. Pretty logical also

Let's see what can we do with it.

adding new attribute to new file _attributes_/_defautl.rb_
```
default["cheftutorial"]["name"] = "babagalamaga"

```

and use it from welcome message

```
log "Hello #{ENV['USER']}" do
  level :info
end

log "And attribute is also here #{node['cheftutorial']['name']}" do
   level :info
end

```

now if you try it to run in old way, youll get an error

```
chef-apply recipes/welcome.rb
[2016-03-24T10:58:31+01:00] FATAL: Stacktrace dumped to /home/vagrant/.chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out
[2016-03-24T10:58:31+01:00] FATAL: Please provide the contents of the stacktrace.out file if you file a bug report
[2016-03-24T10:58:31+01:00] FATAL: NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass

```

This happens because we're trying to run chef in plain _one-and-only-recipy-mode_ and it doesn't know anything about attributes. Because they live in different folder and all that.

So how can we fix it?

first of all, lets get back to ourt root bigchef folder
```
cd ~/bigchef
```

and run

```
chef-client --local-mode --runlist "recipe[cheftutorial::welcome]"

```


Output should be something like this

```
vagrant@vagrant-VirtualBox:~/projects/big_chef$ chef-client --local-mode --runlist "recipe[cheftutorial::welcome]"
[2016-03-24T11:06:40+01:00] WARN: No config file found or specified on command line, using command line options.

```

so far so good. But what if we want to run several recipes at once?

Well, let's try

crating new recipe hello.rb at cheftutorial/recipes folder

```
log "Hello guy someghing #{node['cheftutorial']['name']}" do
   level :info
end

```

and run chef-apply again from root folder of the project (*not* cheftutorial folder)

```
vagrant@vagrant-VirtualBox:~/projects/big_chef$ chef-client --local-mode --runlist "cheftutorial::welcome,cheftutorial::hello"
```

as you can see, you can specify as many recipes as you want. this is why it is called runLIST.
